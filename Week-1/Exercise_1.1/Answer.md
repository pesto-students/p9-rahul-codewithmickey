When a user enters a URL into a browser, the browser first sends a request to the domain name server (DNS) to resolve the domain name in the URL to an IP address. The DNS server responds with the IP address of the web server hosting the website.

The browser then sends an HTTP request to the web server, using the IP address obtained from the DNS resolution. The web server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which typically includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the website.

The browser then renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the website on the user's screen.

In summary, The browser first resolves the domain name of the URL to an IP address using the DNS, then sends an HTTP request to the web server using that IP address, and finally, renders the website using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files received from the web server.

1. The main functionality of a browser is to display and navigate web pages. It allows users to access and interact with the content on the Internet.

2. High-level components of a browser include:

* User interface: This includes the address bar, navigation buttons, bookmarks, and other elements that allow the user to interact with the browser.
* Browser engine: This manages the interactions between the user interface and the rendering engine.
* Rendering engine: This is responsible for displaying the web page on the screen.
* Networking: This handles the communication between the browser and the web server, including the sending and receiving of HTTP requests and responses.
* JavaScript engine: This runs the JavaScript code on a web page.
* Data storage: This stores data such as cookies, cache, and browsing history.

3. The rendering engine is responsible for interpreting and displaying the web page on the screen. It takes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and renders it into a visual representation that can be displayed to the user.

4. Parsers are responsible for interpreting and understanding the code of a web page. For example, an HTML parser reads and interprets the HTML code, while a CSS parser reads and interprets the CSS code.

5. Script processors are responsible for executing any scripts on a web page, such as JavaScript. They interpret and execute the code, allowing the web page to be dynamic and interactive.

6. Tree construction is the process of creating a tree-like structure of the elements on a web page. The HTML code is parsed and the elements are represented as nodes in the tree, with parent-child relationships. This tree is then used by the rendering engine to display the page.

7. The order of script processing refers to the order in which scripts are executed on a web page. This can affect the behavior of the page and may need to be considered when developing web pages.

8. Layout and painting are two stages of the rendering process. Layout involves determining the size, position, and other characteristics of the elements on the page, while painting involves drawing the elements on the screen. This is done using the information in the tree structure created during tree construction.
